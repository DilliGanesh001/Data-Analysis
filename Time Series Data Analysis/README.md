## Introduction
This project focuses on time series analysis of global land temperatures using the **GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv** dataset. The aim is to analyze temperature trends over time and gain insights into climate change patterns.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical temperature data across different countries and states.
- Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in temperature data.
- Assess stationarity of the time series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is **GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv**, which contains temperature data for various states worldwide. Key features in the dataset include:
- **Country**: The country in which the temperature was recorded.
- **State**: The state in which the temperature was recorded.
- **dt**: Date of the recorded temperature.
- **AverageTemperature**: The average temperature for the given date.
- **AverageTemperatureUncertainty**: The uncertainty associated with the average temperature measurement.

## Methodology
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and formatting dates appropriately.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing temperature trends and patterns over time.
3. **Stationarity Test**: Assessing the stationarity of the time series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
4. **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaking down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
5. **Modeling**: Implementing time series forecasting models or other analyses based on the findings.
6. **Evaluation**: Analyzing results and extracting insights from the temperature trends.

## Results
Key findings from the time series analysis include:
- Trends in average temperatures over the years.
- Seasonal patterns observed in temperature fluctuations.
- Stationarity results from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicating whether the time series is stationary or requires differencing.

## Conclusion
The time series analysis of global land temperatures provided valuable insights into temperature trends and potential climate change implications. The stationarity assessment using the ADF test helps inform further modeling approaches and interpretations.

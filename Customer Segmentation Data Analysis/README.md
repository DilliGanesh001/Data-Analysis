## Introduction
This project involves customer segmentation analysis based on the Mall_Customers dataset. 
The purpose of this analysis is to identify distinct customer segments, which can be leveraged 
for targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

## Objectives
- Identify distinct customer segments within the mall dataset.
- Provide actionable insights for marketing campaigns.
- Enhance customer relationship management through tailored offerings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is **Mall_Customers.csv**, which contains information about customers 
visiting a mall. The key features in the dataset include:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

## Methodology
The analysis employs K-means clustering to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their income
and spending score. The following steps were performed:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize customer demographics and spending behavior.
3. Implementation of K-means clustering to identify customer segments.
4. Visualization of the resulting clusters using scatter plots.

## Results
The key findings from the customer segmentation analysis include:
- Identification of three distinct customer segments based on income and spending behavior.
- Visualizations demonstrate clear differentiation between segments, aiding in understanding customer characteristics.
- Recommendations for targeted marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

## Conclusion
The analysis successfully identified distinct customer segments within the mall dataset. 
These insights can be utilized to create targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. 
Further analysis could involve exploring additional features or implementing other clustering algorithms.
